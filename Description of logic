# Firmware & Operation

The robotic arm is controlled by the STC15W408AS Dual-Joystick & Servo Controller. 

Principle of Operation:
1. Joystick Input:
   - Each joystick provides analog voltage (0–5V) for X and Y axes.
   - Signals are read by the onboard ADC of the STC15 microcontroller.

2. PWM Output:
   - The microcontroller converts joystick positions into servo angles.
   - Generates PWM signals (1–2 ms pulse every 20 ms) for SG1–SG4 outputs.
   - Each servo moves according to joystick direction.

3. Buttons & LEDs:
   - KEY1–KEY9 provide digital input for modes or claw control.
   - LEDs indicate joystick movements and button presses.

Usage Notes:
- The board is fully autonomous.
- No coding or firmware modification is required.
- All servo and joystick functions are controlled directly by the STC15 firmware.
