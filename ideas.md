**Original Proposal with Analysis**

The main goal of this project was to build a simple prototype of a robotic arm capable of basic tasks such as holding small objects and assisting with delicate operations like soldering. These goals were achieved: we assembled a functional model, set up the control system, and demonstrated that the concept works. The prototype can keep components in a fixed position and can potentially make manual tasks much easier.

However, several goals were not fully met. The biggest issue is the low torque of the servomotors — they aren’t powerful enough, which reduces stability when the arm holds heavier objects. The limited number of degrees of freedom also restricts mobility, and the gripper frame is too simple and not rigid enough to handle objects of different shapes reliably.

With more time and resources, the following improvements would be most important:

* upgrading to more powerful and precise servomotors;
* adding more degrees of freedom to expand movement capabilities;
* reinforcing and redesigning the gripper for better strength and adaptability.

Overall, the project proved that the concept is viable, and with further upgrades it could become a useful tool for precise technical tasks.
